<!-- 
We use many-to-many element to create the one-to-many relationship between the Student and Phone entities. 
Since a student can have any number of phone numbers we use a collection to hold the values. In this case we use Set.
Many-to-many element is usually used to create many-to-many relationship, 
here we place the unique constraint on the PHONE_ID column, this makes the relationship one-to-many.
